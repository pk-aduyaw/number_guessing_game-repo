# number_guessing_game

The goal of this project is to create a game that allows users to guess a number between 1 and 15.
The predicted number when matched against the computer-generated number and is right will print a congratulatory message and end the game.
When a wrong number is entered, a message is printed out to the user to input the correct number. When the predicted number is in the range
but is not what the computer-generated, the user has the chance to repeatedly predict or guess other numbers until the right number is predicted.
